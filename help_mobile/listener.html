        <p>The listener page allows you to check the status of the underlying mwc713 listeners.
            The green light indicates connected and the red light indicates disconnected.</p>
        <p>The most important function of this page is that it allows you to obtain a new mwcmq address.
            It is suggested that you create a new receive address each time you receive funds.</p>
        <p>In order to do this, first click the 'stop' button next to MWC MQS. Then click 'next address'.
            Alternatively you can go to a specific index by clicking on 'To index'.</p>
