        <p>When receiving MWC via file transfer, the signed response file (with extension .response) needs to be sent back to the sender for the transaction to be finalized and published to the blockchain. </p>
        <p>Please note that the signed response file is generated at the same location where the file containing the sending of the MWC coins is, with the same file name prefix as the .tx file but with the .response suffix. Please upload the file to send to the sender. </p>
