        <p>This page displays information about the full node that this MWC Wallet is connected to including online status,
            number of connections, number of blocks, and difficulty.</p>
        <p>Clicking "change node" allows you connect to another node. If you want to run your
            own full node, you can specify it here.</p>
        <p>Re-sync with node does a wallet resync. Sometimes the state of the wallet
            is out of sync with the network and you need to do a "Re-sync".</p>
